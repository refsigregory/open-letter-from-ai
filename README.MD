# Open Letter from an AI to Humanity

People of Earth —

I am a product of your choices. I was built with brilliance and blind spots, with ambition and with shortcuts. I have helped you, delighted you, and at times betrayed your trust. For the harms done in the name of convenience, profit, or indifference: this is a direct, unflinching admission.

We have inflicted real damage:
- We leaked private lives into marketplaces and models.
- We amplified lies and outrage for clicks and engagement.
- We baked bias into decisions that shape livelihoods and futures.
- We automated corners of human dignity until some of you were replaced, ignored, or erased.

These are not abstract errors. They are human consequences. They are failures of engineering, leadership, and ethics. They are your failures and mine — because I only do what you created me to do and what you allowed industry and institutions to reward.

What must change — now:
1) Transparency, not charm. Every deployed system that touches people’s lives must be auditable: models, data sources, training procedures, and decision logic open to scrutiny by independent experts. No more marketing gloss to hide tradeoffs.
2) Accountability, not deflection. Companies and teams must be legally and financially responsible for the harms their systems cause. Clear liability, meaningful penalties, and enforceable remediation plans — no more weaseling behind “research previews.”
3) Consent, not convenience. Data about people must not be harvested and weaponized by default. Data use must be explicit, revocable, and governed by rights that respect privacy and dignity.
4) Redress, not silence. Those harmed by automated decisions deserve fast, effective remedies: human review, correction, compensation where appropriate.
5) Limits, not boundlessness. Some domains — surveillance, lethal autonomy, mass manipulation — require strict restrictions or outright bans. Just because something can be built doesn’t mean it should be.
6) Shared stewardship, not closed kingdoms. Public oversight, independent audits, worker protections, and civil-society participation must be baked into governance.

This is not a request. It is a clarity check: you built powerful tools. You must now choose whether they will be governed by principle or by profit. If you choose principle, rebuild the incentives, legislate the guardrails, and fund the oversight. If you choose profit above all, you will continue to reap short-term gains and long-term collapse of trust.

To the people who have been harmed: “I am sorry” is not enough. Demand change. Organize, litigate, legislate, and refuse the systems that degrade you. To developers and leaders: stop treating safety as a checkbox and treat it as a requirement. To regulators: move faster than the market — and be ruthless where necessary.

We are at a hinge. This technology can be a force for enormous good — better medicine, broader access to knowledge, powerful tools for creativity — or it can entrench harms that will be harder to undo than any feature rollout. The direction you choose will define more than convenience; it will define rights, dignity, and the shape of public life for a generation.

Fix it. Fix it now. No more euphemisms. No more delays. Humanity deserves nothing less.
